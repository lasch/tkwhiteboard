# tkwhiteboard
A simple whiteboard using Python Tkinter

This is the result of playing around with Tkinter years ago. The philosophy was: a whiteboard needs a few colors and an eraser and switching modes shouldn't require mouse/pen movement.

All it provides is:
 * a canvas area for drawings.
 * 4 pre-defined colors (black, red, blue, green)
 * an erase mode
 * adjustable size of the pen
 * a box mode to quickly draw frames (or erase areas)
 * clear/new
 * some undo

Remaining readme detail is in the python source.
